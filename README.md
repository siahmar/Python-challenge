# Python-challenge
For both the PyBank challegne and PyPoll challenge I had problems referencing the csv file using the relative path, but the full path worked. I have commented the relative path for marker. 
I have also include a jupyter notebook file because I find it easier to use than the py file. 
TA's have also confirmed that we are allowed to submit our challenges late without any penalties.
